Welcome! I am currently a last-year master's student at Guangzhou Institute of Technology, Xidian University, China, under the supervision of Prof. [Cheng Deng](https://see.xidian.edu.cn/faculty/chdeng/) and Dr. [Lingling An](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=DZuZUBYAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). Before pursuing my graduate studies, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Information Security from Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology.

My research interests focus on the security and privacy issues of Trustworthy Machine Learning, aiming to mitigate potential vulnerabilities in deep neural networks while ensuring the privacy of their training data. I am also interested in the intersection between AI and Security, especially in the era of Large Models (LMs). By the way, I am very open to in-depth discussions or collaborations with my peers.
