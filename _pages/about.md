Welcomeüòä! I am currently a second-year master student at the Guangzhou Institute of Technology, Xidian University, China, under the supervision of Prof. [Lingling An](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=DZuZUBYAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), and co-supervised by Asst. Prof. [Xuyu Wang](https://users.cs.fiu.edu/~xuywang/) from Florida International University. Before pursuing my graduate studies, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Information Security from Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology.

My research interests focuse on the robustness and fairness of **trustworthy AI**, particularly in the context of **federated learning**, for the application in real-world scenarios involving large-scale, heterogeneous clients, such as [human activity recognition](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3580795). I am very open to having in-depth discussions or collaborations with my peers.

<span style="color:red"> I plan to apply for a CS PhD position (Globalüåç) for Fall 2024, and if my research interests align with your team, please feel free to contact me :)
