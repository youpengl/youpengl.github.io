Welcome! I am currently a last-year master's student at Guangzhou Institute of Technology, Xidian University, China, under the supervision of Prof. [Lingling An](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=DZuZUBYAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). Before pursuing my graduate studies, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Information Security from Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology.

My research interests focus on the security, privacy, and fairness aspects of **trustworthy machine learning**, aiming to mitigate potential vulnerabilities and biases in deep neural network models while ensuring the privacy of their training data. Potential applications involve coordinating clients to collaboratively train a generic foundation model with trustworthiness for practical use (e.g., AIoT, healthcare) in a distributed or federated manner. By the way, I am very open to in-depth discussions or collaborations with my peers.

<span style="color:red"> I am planning to apply for a CS Ph.D. program in Fall 2024, and if my research interests align with your team, please feel free to contact me :)
