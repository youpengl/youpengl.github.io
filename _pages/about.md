I am currently a first-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at [The University of Texas at Dallas](https://cs.utdallas.edu), under the supervision of Prof. [Xinda Wang](https://www.xindawang.org). Before this, I obtained my masterâ€™s degree from Xidian University, China.

My current research focuses on AI for Software Security, primarily exploring and enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for vulnerability detection. I am also interested in Trustworthy AI (e.g., LLM security) and have published several papers in the fields of Federated Learning and AI Security. I am always open to in-depth discussions or collaborations with peers and feel free to contact me.
